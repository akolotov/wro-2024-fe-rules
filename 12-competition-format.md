*The description in this document explains how the competition will be done at the International Final. National and regional competitions can use this model or customise this model for their own competitions.*

12.1. The competition consists of several challenge rounds with practice time in between. After each practice time, there will be a vehicle check time to review the requirements.

12.2. Each team must work during practice time in their specified place until the check time, when the teamâ€™s vehicle must be placed in a designated area (checking area).

12.3. On the day of the competition, there will be a minimum of 60 minutes of practice time before the start of the first round.

12.4. Teams cannot touch the designated competition areas before the start of the practice time is announced.

12.5. During practice time, the contestants may work in their places, or may queue with their vehicles to have one test attempt on the game field or may take measurements in the game field in so far as this does not interfere with other teams' test attempts. The maximum time allowed per team for one practice attempt is 4 minutes. After 4 minutes a team may fall in at the back of the que for another practice attempt. Teams are allowed to make changes to the program or to adjust the vehicle mechanically.

12.6. All vehicles must be placed on the reviewing table in the checking area for preparatory review (vehicle check) after the end of the practice period. ***All controllers of the vehicle must be powered off.*** No mechanisms or programs may be modified after this time.

12.7. Vehicles may take part in the competition only after they have passed the vehicle check. The check is concerning the requirements to the vehicle and materials used, as described in the sections above.

12.8. If a vehicle does not pass the vehicle check by the judges, the judges may provide a team up to 3 minutes to address issues found. Only one three minutes period can be provided by judges for a team per each check time slot.

12.9. If eventually a vehicle does not pass the vehicle check by the judges, the vehicle may not be used in the competition.
