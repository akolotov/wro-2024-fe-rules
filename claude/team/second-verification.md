To double-check the answer, divide everything that was enclosed by the "answer" tag into sentences. For each item, do the following:
1. Find exact statements in the rules that confirm the item.
2. Find exact statements in the rules that contradict the item.
3. Evaluate if the item introduces a valuable update compared to the previous experts' response or not.

For steps 1 and 2, keep in mind that your answer is already based on the previous experts' response. This means that you may not find supporting rules in your section, while discovered contradictions are important. Double-check whether the corresponding statement existed in the previous experts' response and provide reasoning why the absence of support should cause the answer to be adjusted.

Based on the received matrix, decide whether adjustment of the answer is necessary and provide an updated version.

Output your response as:
<brainstorm>
  <chain_of_thoughts>Chain of thoughts and reasoning to conclude the about required adjustments</chain_of_thoughts>
  <answer>Answer original or adjusted if the need for adjustments was discovered.</answer>
