# **7. Engineer’s documentation on GitHub**

Real engineering is about creating a solution and communicating or sharing the idea with others
to bring the whole idea a step further. In addition to designing and programming the vehicle,
teams must provide documentation that presents their engineering progress, the final vehicle
design and final vehicle source code. This documentation must be uploaded to the GitHub public
repository, and a hardcopy must be submitted at the international final. Details about the scoring
of the documentation can be found in Appendix C of this document. <new_in_2024>For the international competition, all information and documentation on GitHub must be done in English.</new_in_2024>

Each team must provide the following:

- Discussion, <new_in_2024>information</new_in_2024> and motivation for the vehicle’s mobility, power and sense, and obstacle management.
- Photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom), and a team photo.
- URL to YouTube (should be either public or accessible by link) showing the vehicle
driving autonomously. That part of the video where driving demonstration exists, must be
at least 30 seconds in length. One video for each challenge must be provided.
- <new_in_2024>Link to a GitHub **public** repository with the code for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition. The repository may also include the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. The history of commits should contain at least 3 commits:</new_in_2024>
    - <new_in_2024>the first commit not later than 2 months before the competition – it must contain not less than 1/5 of the final amount of the code.</new_in_2024>
    - <new_in_2024>The second commit not later than 1 month before the competition,</new_in_2024>
    - <new_in_2024>The third commit not later than 2 weeks before the competition.</new_in_2024>
    - <new_in_2024>More commits are allowed.</new_in_2024>
    
    <new_in_2024>The repository must contain a README.md file with a short description in English (not less than 5000 characters) of the designed solution. The goal of the description is to clarify which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicle’s controllers. A template for the GitHub repos is available on https://github.com/World-Robot-Olympiad-Association/wro2022-fe-template.</new_in_2024>
    
    <new_in_2024>The repository has to be public from the moment when it is submitted for an international competition and has to stay public at least 12 months after the competition. The idea of Future Engineers is to encourage new teams and support them in finding existing solutions and get inspired by them. If a repository is not public before the event, the team will get reduced points for the documentation. WRO Association has the right to republish the repository at any time.</new_in_2024>
    
- <new_in_2024>GitHub repositories must be set for public viewing.</new_in_2024>
- <new_in_2024>Code provided on GitHub and Hard Copy must be well documented with comments in the code. Judges might not have access to the specific programs used by teams to develop their code, e.g. EV3, Spike or Scratch.</new_in_2024>
