# **8. Challenge rounds**

For the ***International Final*** there will be four rounds, two for the Open Challenge and two for the Obstacle Challenge. The direction for each challenge round, <new_in_2024>the starting position, and the layout of the track</new_in_2024> will be chosen randomly. The direction in which the vehicle must move during the challenges is defined as the challenge driving direction.

## **Open Challenge rounds**

During Open Challenge rounds, the racetrack will have no traffic signs.

![The image shows a robotics competition field for the Open Challenge round. The track is defined by outer and inner square walls, forming a lane for the vehicle. There are no traffic signs present on the track. A yellow self-driving car with a camera on top is positioned on the field. Colored lines connect the corners of the inner and outer squares, guiding the vehicle’s orientation. The center platform displays the “FUTURE ENGINEERS” logo, which is not part of the track.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcc84f75-a08e-44e5-94e8-8418e8377ebf/ee61dfa5-98c8-4335-baf7-2ddda225bbe7/image.png)

**Figure 5: The game field for challenge one rounds**

The distance between the track borders could be either 1000 mm or 600 mm (+/- 100 mm for the International Final).

![The image shows three variations of the game field for the Open Challenge rounds in a robotics competition. Each field consists of an outer and inner square with a central platform featuring the “FUTURE ENGINEERS” logo. In the top left image, the left corridor between the inner and outer walls is narrower. In the top right image, the left and top corridors are narrower. In the bottom image, the top and bottom corridors are wider. A yellow self-driving car is shown in different starting positions, facing different directions.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcc84f75-a08e-44e5-94e8-8418e8377ebf/1235f067-1b79-4e3b-a0f6-6c73c8f7cfae/image.png)

## **Obstacle Challenge rounds**

During Obstacle Challenge rounds, the red and green pillars will be set up on the racetrack as
the traffic signs. <new_in_2024>In addition, two boundaries will be placed and form a parking lot.</new_in_2024> The distance between the track borders will be always 1000 mm (+/- 10 mm for the International Final).

![The image shows two variations of the game field for the Obstacle Challenge rounds in a robotics competition. Both fields have red and green pillars set up on the track as traffic signs. The yellow self-driving car, equipped with a camera, is placed in different starting positions and directions in each field. Magenta wooden barriers are visible, indicating the parking lot. The corridors between the outer and inner walls remain constant in width across both fields.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcc84f75-a08e-44e5-94e8-8418e8377ebf/c2d5c0cb-4bf2-48b5-a5c0-3b2ea49a6c79/image.png)

**Figure 7: Examples of the game field for Obstacle Challenge rounds**

<new_in_2024>In the straight section with the parking lot, no traffic signs can be placed on the positions close to the outer wall. This avoids, that traffic signs block the access to the parking lot.</new_in_2024>

![The image shows a straight section of the robotics competition field near a parking lot. Green and red squares within circles, outlined by yellow solid lines, represent potential positions for traffic signs. The positions marked with an X near the outer wall are forbidden for placing traffic signs to ensure they do not block access to the parking lot, which is indicated by magenta barriers at the bottom of the image. The inner positions are allowed for placing traffic signs.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcc84f75-a08e-44e5-94e8-8418e8377ebf/715ab600-7280-4288-87b9-cd9cea834001/image.png)
