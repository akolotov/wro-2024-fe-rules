Appendix A provides detailed explanations and visual aids for various aspects of the WRO Future Engineers competition rules. It clarifies potentially ambiguous situations and offers specific criteria for judging different scenarios during the competition. The appendix uses numerous diagrams and examples to illustrate rule interpretations, ensuring consistent application across all competition events.

1. Meaning of moved or knocked down traffic sign: This section defines the criteria for determining whether a traffic sign has been moved or knocked down during the competition. It provides visual examples of different scenarios, categorizing them as not moved, moved but allowed, or moved in a way that causes the round to stop. The section uses clear illustrations to demonstrate the acceptable and unacceptable positions of traffic signs relative to their designated circles, helping judges and teams understand the exact boundaries of rule compliance.
2. Conditions to get points for finishing in the starting section: This part explains how to determine if a vehicle has successfully finished within the starting section. It specifies that the vehicle's projection on the mat is used for this assessment and provides examples of correct and incorrect finishing positions. The section emphasizes that any part of the vehicle outside the straightforward section where the starting zone is located disqualifies it from receiving points for finishing. It also notes that the vehicle must remain stationary for at least 30 seconds to be considered finished.
3. Passing the starting section after three laps: This section clarifies when judges will end the round after a vehicle completes three laps. It describes different phases of the vehicle's movement relative to the starting section and uses diagrams to illustrate when time should be stopped. The explanation covers both clockwise and counterclockwise driving directions, ensuring comprehensive understanding of round completion criteria.
4. Driving in the opposite direction: This part explains the rules regarding driving in the opposite direction of the designated round direction. It provides several case studies with detailed explanations and diagrams, covering scenarios such as changing direction multiple times and driving back-to-front. The section clarifies the conditions under which opposite direction driving is allowed and when it would cause the round to be stopped, helping teams understand the limits of their vehicle's movement strategies.
5. Passing traffic signs from the incorrect side: This section defines the threshold for passing traffic signs incorrectly. It explains that judges will not stop time if the vehicle has not completely crossed the line (radius) extending from the inner to outer wall where the traffic sign is located. The explanation includes diagrams showing both allowed and disallowed scenarios, helping teams understand the exact point at which an incorrect pass would end the round.
6. Parking in the parking lot: New for 2024, this section explains the criteria for successful parking in the designated lot. It defines fully parked and partly parked situations using clear diagrams. The section also specifies that touching the parking lot limitations results in no points for parking, providing teams with precise guidelines for this new challenge element.
