# **4. Game documents and rule hierarchy**

4.1. Every year, WRO publishes a new version of general rules for this category including the concrete description of the self-driving vehicle game. These rules are the basis for all international WRO events. 

4.2. During a season, WRO may publish additional Question & Answers (Q&As) that can clarify, extend, or re-define rules in game and general rule documents. Teams should read these Q&A’s before the competition.

4.3. The general rule document and Q&A’s may be different in a country due to local adaptations through the National Organizer. Teams need to inform themselves about the rules that apply in their country. For any international WRO event, only the information WRO has published is relevant. Teams that qualified for any international WRO event should inform themselves about possible differences to their local rules.

4.4. At the competition day, the following rule hierarchy applies:

4.4.1. General rule document builds the basis for rules in this category.

4.4.2. Questions & Answers (Q&A’s) can overwrite rules in game and general rule documents.

4.4.3. The head judge on the competition day has the final word in any decision.
