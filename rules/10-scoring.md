# **10. Scoring**

10.1. The official score will be calculated at the end of each challenge round.

10.2. The maximum score is calculated as follow:

10.2.1. 30 points for the Open Challenge round. (1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3)

10.2.2. <new_in_2024>70</new_in_2024> points for the Obstacle Challenge round. (1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3 and either 1.4 (or 1.5) or 1.6 (or 1.7) + 1.8 + <new_in_2024>1.9</new_in_2024>)

10.2.3. 30 points for the engineering journal documentation

10.2.4. Maximum score is <new_in_2024>130</new_in_2024>. (≈ 75% vehicle performance and ≈ 25% documentation)

| 1. | **Driving Open and Obstacle Challenge** |  |  |
| 1.1. | The vehicle drives from a section in the challenge driving direction. This is applicable for the starting section, but not applicable for the finish section and other section next after it. | 1 | 24 |
| 1.2. | The vehicle drives a full lap. 8 sections were passed successfully in the challenge driving direction. The starting section is included in the eight sections for the first lap. The lap is considered as completed if the vehicle completely drives out of the last (corner) section in the lap. So, the vehicle can start moving in the opposite direction after this and the lap will be still considered. | 1 | 3 |
| 1.3.  | After the completion of three laps the vehicle stopped in the finish section. | 3 | 3 |
|  | ***Additional points for Obstacle Challenge rounds:*** |  |  |
|  | <new_in_2024>***Not completed three laps***</new_in_2024> |  |  |
| 1.4. | One or more traffic signs were <new_in_2024>moved</new_in_2024>. Vehicle must complete at least one round to qualify for score. | 2 | 2 |
| 1.5. | The traffic signs were not <new_in_2024>moved<new_in_2024>. Vehicle must complete at least one round to qualify for score. | 4 | 4 |

| 2. | The team performed repairing actions by taking the vehicle out of the field even if the actions were not successful. |  | Total round points divided by
factor 2 |
| 3. | **Engineering journal and vehicle documentation.**
Refer to appendix C for a breakdown of the engineering journal scoring. |  | 30 |

10.3. The time measured by a judge, the moment of the open challenge round ends, is written down and will be later used to identify the best round. If a team or vehicle was disqualified for the challenge round, the maximum time (3 minutes) is given for such a challenge round.

10.4. The score calculation is done by the judges at the conclusion of each challenge round. The team must verify and sign the score sheet after the round if they have no fair complaints.

10.5. The teams’ ranks for Open Challenge rounds are based on points each team received in their best Open Challenge rounds. If a team has the same score in both rounds, the round with the smallest time will be chosen as the best Open Challenge round.

10.6. All teams will compete in both challenge rounds.

10.7. The teams’ ranks for overall competition are built based on the sum of each team’s points received in the best Open Challenge round, points received in the best Obstacle Challenge round and points received for the engineering journal and vehicle documentation. If a team has the same score in both Obstacle Challenge rounds, the round with the quickest time will be chosen as the best Obstacle Challenge round.

10.8. If there is a tie between two teams, ranking will be determined by considering the following results (the first in the list is the highest priority, the last in the list is the lowest priority):

10.8.1. Sum of points received in Open Challenge round, points received in the Obstacle
Challenge round and points received for the engineering journal and vehicle
documentation.

10.8.2. Points of the best Obstacle Challenge round

10.8.3. Time for the best Obstacle Challenge round

10.8.4. Points of the second-best Obstacle Challenge round

10.8.5. Time for the second-best Obstacle Challenge round

10.8.6. Points for the engineering journal and vehicle documentation

10.8.7. Points for the best Open Challenge round

10.8.8. Points of the second-best Open Challenge round

10.8.9. Time for the best Open Challenge round

10.8.10. Time for the second-best Open Challenge round
