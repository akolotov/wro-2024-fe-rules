# **Appendix C: Engineering journal evaluation**

The following guideline will be used to evaluate the engineering journal and vehicle documentation. Below is the list of scoring items and criteria for every item:

| **Scoring Area** | **Maximum** Score |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Mobility Management  | 4 |
| 2. Power and Sense Management  | 4 |
| 3. Obstacle Management  | 4 |
| 4. Pictures – Team and vehicle  | 4 |
| 5. Performance videos | 4 |
| 6. GitHub utilization | 4 |
| 7. Engineering Factor | 4 |
| 8. Overall Judge impression  | 2 |
| Total score: | 30 |

The process to perform the vehicle documentation evaluation could be the following:

1. There are at least three judges which who will evaluate the documentation.
2. Every judge gets familiar with the vehicle documentation and provides his evaluation for every scoring item as per described criteria. The judge is not allowed to skip any scoring item. No discussion between judges is allowed at this moment. The evaluation of the item is based on the judge’s understanding of the criteria and his feeling about how the corresponding criteria is reflected in the documentation – this is not a comparison of documentation materials provided by several teams between each other.
3. Average value for every scoring item is calculated based on the judges’ marks.
4. The sum of all averaged scoring items is the total for the vehicle documentation for any particular team.

## Rubric for judging engineering documentation

<new_in_2024>

### Rubric scale explanation

- **No evidence or discussion provided:** Nothing provided
- **Inadequate:** Too little information or information provided is not understood.
- **Needs improvement:** Sufficient information is provided but it is clear that the effort cannot be duplicated.
- **Meets expectations:** An exact duplication by another team can be made effortless from the information provided
- **Exceeds expectations:** Not only can an exact duplication be made from the information provided, but information on improvements is also provided.

</new_in_2024>

### 1. **Mobility Management**

Mobility management discussion should cover how the vehicle movements are managed. What motors are selected, how they are selected and implemented. A brief discussion regarding the vehicle chassis design /selection can be provided as well as the mounting of all components to the vehicle chassis/structure. The discussion may include engineering principles such as speed, torque, power etc. usage. Building or assembly instructions can be provided together with 3D CAD files to 3D print parts.

| No evidence or discussion provided | 0 |
| --- | --- |
| Inadequate | 1 |
| Needs improvement | 2 |
| Meets expectations | 3 |
| Exceeds expectations  | 4 |

### 2. **Power and Sense Management**

Power and Sense management discussion should cover the power source for the vehicle as well as the sensors required to provide the vehicle with information to negotiate the different challenges. The discussion can include the reasons for selecting various sensors and how they are being used on the vehicle together with power consumption. The discussion could include a wiring diagram with BOM for the vehicle that includes all aspects of professional wiring diagrams.

| No evidence provided or discussion provided | 0 |

| Inadequate | 1 |
| Needs improvement | 2 |
| Meets expectations | 3 |
| Exceeds expectations  | 4 |

4. https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/build-your-own-robot-design-and-schematic/

### 3. **Obstacle Management**

Obstacle management discussion should include the strategy for the vehicle to negotiate the obstacle course for all the challenges. This could include flow diagrams, pseudo code and source code with detailed comments.

| No source code or discussion provided  | 0 |
| --- | --- |
| Inadequate | 1 |
| Needs improvement | 2 |
| Meets expectations | 3 |
| Exceeds expectations  | 4 |

### 4. **Pictures – Team and vehicle**

Pictures of the team and robot must be provided. The pictures of the robot must cover all sides of the robot, must be clear, in focus and show aspects of the mobility, power and sense, and obstacle management. Reference in the discussion sections 1, 2 and 3 can be made to these pictures. Team photo is necessary for judges to relate and identify the team during the local and international competitions.

| No Team or vehicle pictures provided | 0 |
| --- | --- |
| Inadequate | 1 |
| Needs improvement | 2 |
| Meets expectations | 3 |
| Exceeds expectations  | 4 |

### 5. **Performance videos**

The performance videos must demonstrate the performance of the vehicle from start to finish for each challenge. The videos could include an overlay of commentary, titles or animations. The video could also include aspects of section 1, 2 or 3.

| No video evidence provided  | 0 |
| --- | --- |
| Inadequate | 1 |
| Needs improvement | 2 |
| Meets expectations | 3 |
| Exceeds expectations  | 4 |

### 6. **GitHub utilization**

Git and GitHub are available for open source project management and file version control. As part of the design and development process, teams must use this platform to document their progress, coding development and share files. Judging the platform will include how complete the information provided is, how information is structured and how often commits were done. Teams can use this platform to provide additional information on their engineering design and coding of their vehicle as well.

| No evidence provided of GitHub use  | 0 |
| --- | --- |
| Inadequate | 1 |
| Needs improvement | 2 |
| Meets expectations | 3 |
| Exceeds expectations  | 4 |
