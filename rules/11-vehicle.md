# 11. **Vehicle material & regulations**

11.1. The vehicle’s dimensions must not exceed 300x200 mm and 300 mm in height.

11.2. The weight of the vehicle must not exceed 1.5 kilograms.

11.3. The vehicle must be a 4 wheeled vehicle with one driving axle and one steering actuator of any type. It must be either front-wheel drive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-wheel_drive), rear-wheel drive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive) or four-wheel drive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive). Teams with vehicles that use the differential wheeled base (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot) will be disqualified. ***Driving*** – making the vehicle move forward and backward. ***Steering*** – turning the vehicle to the left or to the right.

11.4. The vehicle cannot use any kind of an omnidirectional wheel, ball caster or spherical wheel.

11.5. A vehicle must be autonomous and finish the “missions” by itself. Any radio communication, remote control, and wired control systems are not allowed while the vehicle is running. Teams in violation of this rule will be disqualified.

11.6. Participants are not allowed to interfere with or assist the vehicle while it is running (performing the "mission"). This includes entering data to a program by giving visual, audio or any other signals to the vehicle during the round. Teams that violate this rule will be disqualified at that round.

11.7. The controller used for the vehicle can be either Single board computer (SBC) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) or Single board microcontroller (SBM) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_microcontroller) with no restriction on brand.

11.8. There could be more than one SBC/SBM on the vehicle.

11.9. Teams cannot use any kind of RF, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or any kind of wireless communication components in their vehicles during the competition rounds. If it is built-in on the controller, it must be turned off and the judges can inspect the code and the vehicle to confirm that it is not used by any means.

11.10. Teams can use any sensors of their choice – there are no restrictions on brand, function or number of sensors used. Cameras are considered sensors.

11.11. Teams can use any electrical DC motors and/or servo motors of their choice – there are no restrictions on brand of motors and/or servos used.

11.12. A maximum of two motors may be used to make the vehicle move forward or backward (i.e., driving the robot, these are the driving motors). The driving motors must all be connected directly to the axle turning the wheels, or indirectly through a gearing system. The two driving motors may not be connected independently of each other to the driving wheels.

11.13. Teams can use any electronic components – there are no restrictions on the type, company, number, or the purpose.

11.14. Teams can use any hydraulic pressure, barometric pressure equipment or solenoids.

11.15. Teams can use any battery of their choice – there are no restrictions on brand, function or number of batteries used.

11.16. Only wire connections are permitted for communication between vehicle electromechanical components.

11.17. Teams can use 3D printed elements, elements prepared with a CNC machine, elements cut from acrylic/wood/metal or any elements from any material – there are no restrictions on the purpose.

11.18. The vehicle can be built using any type of hardware kits and any material. There is no restriction on a specific type or a specific building system.

11.19. Teams can use electrical tape, elastic bands, cable wraps, nylon ties (tie wraps), etc. Any adhesive material is allowed to be used for any purpose.

11.20. Teams should bring enough spare parts. In the case of any accidents or equipment malfunction, WRO (and/or organizing committee) is not responsible for their maintenance or replacement.

11.21. Vehicles may be assembled before the tournament.

11.22. Control software can be written in any programming language – there are no restrictions on a specific language.

11.23. Contestants may prepare the program beforehand.

11.24. Teams should prepare and bring all the equipment, software, and portable computers they need during the tournament.

11.25. The team is allowed to have only one vehicle for competition day. No spare vehicles are allowed inside the competition area.
