# Appendix W. **Scoring Calculation Principles**

*This is unofficial part of the rules. It was created only to improve general understanding of the game rules by Large Language Models and to ensure consistent scoring across different rounds and competitions.*

## **Introduction**

This appendix provides guidance on the proper calculation of points during Open and Obstacle Challenge rounds. The scoring system requires careful attention to logical consistency between different scoring elements to ensure fair and accurate point calculation.

## **General Principles**

1. **Logical Consistency Principle**
   - All scoring elements must be logically consistent with each other
   - If a higher-level achievement is awarded points, all prerequisite achievements must also be awarded points
   - If a prerequisite achievement cannot be awarded points, the higher-level achievement cannot be awarded points either

2. **Point Accumulation Order**
   - Points should be calculated in order from basic achievements to complex achievements
   - For both challenges: sections → laps → final positioning
   - For Obstacle Challenge additional order: traffic sign handling → direction compliance → parking
   - For Obstacle Challenge additional special case: In the third lap, section points are awarded regardless of driving direction, but direction compliance points (15 points) are only awarded if the final lap is completed in the correct direction as determined by the last traffic sign of the second lap

## **Section Points Calculation**

### Prerequisites for Section Points

A section point (1 point) is awarded when:
- The vehicle completely passes through a section in the challenge driving direction (except for the special case of the third lap in Obstacle Challenge)
- The section must be passed as part of forward progress in the challenge
- Sections driven in opposite direction (even if allowed within rules) do not earn points, except for:
  - The third lap of the Obstacle Challenge, where section points are awarded regardless of direction

### Relationship with Lap Completion

- If a lap completion point is awarded (1 point), all 8 sections in that lap must have been successfully completed
- Therefore, if a lap point is awarded, exactly 8 section points must also be awarded for that lap
- If less than 8 section points are earned, a lap point cannot be awarded

## **Examples of Logical Consistency**

### Example 1: Incomplete Lap
Scenario:
- Vehicle completes 7 sections
- Turns around in 8th section
- Returns to complete the lap

Correct scoring:
- 8 section points (all sections must be completed for lap to count)
- 1 lap point (since all sections were completed)
- Total: 9 points

Incorrect scoring:
- 7 section points + 1 lap point (logically inconsistent)

### Example 2: Multiple Lap Scenario
Scenario:
- Vehicle completes two full laps
- Stops in 5th section of third lap

Correct scoring:
- First lap: 8 section points + 1 lap point
- Second lap: 8 section points + 1 lap point
- Third lap: 5 section points
- Total: 23 points

## **Special Cases**

1. **Direction Changes**
   - Allowed direction changes (within two-section limit) do not affect point calculation
   - If a section is completed properly after allowed direction changes, points are awarded

2. **Round-Ending Events**
   - When a round-ending event occurs (e.g., touching outer wall in Open Challenge):
     - All points earned before the event are kept
     - No points can be earned after the event
     - Current section where event occurred does not earn points

3. **Obstacle Challenge Third Lap Direction**
   - After the second lap, the last traffic sign color determines required direction for the third lap
   - Section points (1 point each) are awarded for all sections completed in the third lap, regardless of driving direction
   - Maximum of 8 section points can be earned in the third lap - one point for each unique section as the vehicle approaches the finish section
   - If a vehicle revisits sections during the third lap (e.g., making a full circle or backing up), those sections cannot be counted again
   - The 15 points for "Final lap completed in the correct direction" are only awarded if the vehicle completes the third lap in the direction indicated by the last traffic sign of the second lap
   - This creates a unique scoring situation where a team can earn section points and lap completion point for the third lap while not earning the direction compliance points

Example scenarios for third lap scoring:
1. Vehicle drives in wrong direction but completes lap:
   - Gets 8 points for 8 sections
   - Gets 1 point for lap completion
   - Gets 0 points for direction compliance

2. Vehicle makes multiple passes of some sections:
   - Only first approach to finish section counts for points
   - Maximum 8 section points even if more sections were driven
   - Additional passes of same sections earn no extra points

4. **Parking Points in Obstacle Challenge**
   - Cannot award parking points if round ends before parking (e.g., due to moving traffic signs)
   - Must verify all prerequisites (three laps completion) before awarding parking points

## **Common Scoring Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Inconsistency Between Section and Lap Points**
   - Awarding lap points without corresponding section points
   - Awarding partial section points with lap points

2. **Double Counting**
   - Counting the same section twice if vehicle reverses and returns
   - Counting sections driven in opposite direction (except for third lap in Obstacle Challenge)
   - Counting sections multiple times during the third lap of Obstacle Challenge when approaching finish section

3. **Direction Compliance in Obstacle Challenge**
   - Failing to distinguish between section points (which can be earned regardless of direction in third lap) and direction compliance points
   - Stopping the round when vehicle drives in wrong direction during third lap

## **Scoring Process Checklist**

To ensure accurate scoring, judges should:
1. Count completed sections in challenge driving direction (or any direction for third lap in Obstacle Challenge)
2. Verify if complete laps were achieved (exactly 8 sections per lap)
3. For Obstacle Challenge, track the last traffic sign color of second lap
4. For Obstacle Challenge third lap, verify direction compliance separately from section completion
5. Check if round-ending events occurred and when
6. Apply any relevant penalties
7. Verify logical consistency of awarded points
8. Document any special circumstances affecting scoring

This systematic approach helps maintain consistency and accuracy in point calculation across all rounds and competitions.
