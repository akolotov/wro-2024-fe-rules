# **Appendix A: Explanatory schemes**

## **1. Meaning of moved or knocked down traffic sign**

On the schemes below the traffic signs are considered as:

- (a) – not <new_in_2024>moved</new_in_2024>
- (b) – <new_in_2024>moved</new_in_2024>
- (c) – moved but does not cause the round stop
- (d) – knocked down but does not cause the round stop
- (e) – moved and causes the round stop
- (f) – knocked down and causes the round stop

![The image shows three traffic signs illustrating their positions relative to the designated circle during a robotics competition. In (a), the green pillar remains in its initial position and is not considered moved. In (b), the red pillar has moved off the seat but is still within the circle. In (c), the green pillar is partially outside the circle and is considered moved but does not cause the round to stop. Each sign’s movement is assessed based on its position within the yellow circle.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/014.png)

**Figure 14: a) initial position of the traffic sign at the round start; b) the traffic sign is not on the seat but still within the circle; c) the traffic sign is partially outside of the circle and considered as moved**

![The image shows two traffic signs illustrating different outcomes when they are knocked down or moved. In (d), the red traffic sign is knocked down and partially outside the circle but does not cause the round to stop. In (e), the green traffic sign is completely outside the circle, which is considered moved and causes the round to stop. Each situation is evaluated based on the traffic sign’s position relative to the yellow circle.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/015a.png)

**Figure 15a: d) knocked down traffic sign is partially outside of the circle; e) the traffic sign is moved completely outside of the circle**

![The image shows a red traffic sign that has been knocked down and is completely outside the designated circle. This scenario, labeled as (f), causes the round to stop, as the traffic sign has moved entirely beyond the bounds of the yellow circle, which marks the acceptable zone for the sign’s position during the round.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/015b.png)

**Figure 15b: f) knocked down traffic sign is completely outside of the circle**

## **2. Conditions to get points for finishing in the starting section**

To identify if the vehicle finished within the starting section or not, the projection of the vehicle on the mat is used after full stop. If any part of the projection is outside of a straightforward section where the starting zone is located, the vehicle is considered outside of the starting section.

Consideration if the vehicle is within the starting zone or not is possible only if the vehicle stopped and has not moved for at least 30 seconds.

The starting zone on the schemes below is marked by the green colour.

![The image shows two cases of a yellow car in relation to the starting straightforward section and the starting zone (illustrated in green for reference). On the left, the car is fully within the starting straightforward section, but part of its projection extends outside the starting zone. On the right, the car’s projection is completely outside the starting zone but still entirely within the starting straightforward section. Both cases are marked with green checkmarks to indicate the finish.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/016.png)

**Figure 16: The vehicle finished completely within the starting section**

![The image shows two cases of a yellow car in relation to the starting straightforward section and the starting zone (illustrated in green for reference). On the left, the car’s projection touches the green starting zone, but part of the projection is outside the starting straightforward section. On the right, the car’s projection is partially outside the starting straightforward section and completely outside the starting zone. Both cases are marked with red Xs to indicate incorrect finishing positions.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/017.png)

**Figure 17: The vehicle finished outside of the starting section**

## **3. Passing the starting section after three laps**

The judges will end the round as soon as, after driving three laps, the vehicle passes the starting section.

When three laps are completed, the following phases are possible:

![The image shows a yellow car driving counterclockwise toward the starting section after completing three laps. The starting zone is illustrated in green for reference. The vehicle is approaching the starting straightforward section but has not yet fully entered it. The phase represents the moment when the vehicle is still moving toward the starting section, and time will not be stopped by the judges at this stage.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/018a.png)

**Figure 18a: Phases of passing the starting zone by the vehicle moving CCW - the vehicle is driving to the starting section**

![The image shows a yellow car driving counterclockwise after completing three laps. The car is in the process of leaving the starting straightforward section, with the starting zone illustrated in green for reference. The vehicle has already passed through the section, but time will not be stopped by the judges at this stage, as the car has not yet fully exited the area.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/018b.png)

**Figure 18b: Phases of passing the starting zone by the vehicle moving CCW - the vehicle is driving out of the starting section**

![The image shows a yellow car driving counterclockwise after completing three laps. The vehicle has completely exited the starting straightforward section and is now entering the corner zone. At this point, the vehicle is fully outside both the starting section and the starting zone, and the judges will stop the time, as this phase indicates the round’s completion.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/018c.png)

**Figure 18c: Phases of passing the starting zone by the vehicle moving CCW - the vehicle has passed the starting section**

If the vehicle is still moving the judge will not stop time at the phases (Figure 18a) and (Figure 18b). But as soon as the vehicle is completely in the corner zone, the phase (Figure 18c), the round will be ended.

The same is applicable if the round driving direction is clockwise.

![The image shows a yellow car driving clockwise toward the starting section after completing three laps. The vehicle is approaching the starting straightforward section but has not yet fully entered it. This phase represents the moment when the vehicle is still moving toward the starting section, and time will not be stopped by the judges at this stage.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/019a.png)

**Figure 19c: Phases of passing the starting zone by the vehicle moving clockwise - the vehicle has passed the starting zone**

## **4. Driving in the opposite direction**

During the round the vehicle is allowed to drive in the direction opposite to the round driving direction for two sections only: the section where the direction was changed and the neighbour section.

Let’s consider the several cases:

### **Case 1: the vehicle started driving in the opposite direction and stopped completely within the neighbouring section**

![The vehicle, represented by a red and yellow car, has arrived in the corner section (phase 1). It is oriented to follow the blue arrow, which matches the clockwise driving direction (shown by the dashed green arrow near the wall). The vehicle has stopped in this section (phase 2), indicated by the red stop sign. Then, in phase 3, the vehicle begins to move back in the opposite direction (counterclockwise), as shown by the yellow arrow.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/020a.png)

**Figure 20a: Allowed driving in the opposite direction from the corner section: phases 1, 2, 3**

![In phase 3, the vehicle continues driving in the opposite (counterclockwise) direction into the neighboring straightforward section, represented by the yellow arrow. The vehicle stops in the middle of this section (phase 4), as indicated by the red stop sign, without crossing into the next section. The green checkmark shows that this behavior is allowed since the vehicle is permitted to drive in the opposite direction for two sections, and the round will not be stopped.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/020b.png)

**Figure 20b: Allowed driving in the opposite direction from the corner section: phases 3, 4, 5**

![In phase 5, the vehicle resumes movement in the correct clockwise direction, following the blue arrow. The car is now moving forward along the track, back in the correct round driving direction.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/020c.png)

**Figure 20c: Allowed driving in the opposite direction from the corner section: phase 5**

On the figure above the round driving direction is clockwise (presented by the green dotted arrow near to the wall):

- phase 1: the vehicle arrived in the corner section
- phase 2: it stopped
- phase 3: it started driving back
- phase 4: the vehicle stopped in the straightforward section *without crossing the section boundary with the next section*
- phase 5: it continued driving in the round driving direction.

Such manoeuvre is allowed.

### **Case 2: the vehicle started driving in the opposite direction and stopped on the line between two sections**

![The vehicle, represented by a red and yellow car, has arrived in the corner section (phase 1). It is oriented to follow the blue arrow, which matches the clockwise driving direction (indicated by the dashed green arrow near the wall). The vehicle has stopped in this section (phase 2), as shown by the red stop sign. In phase 3, the vehicle begins driving back in the opposite direction (counterclockwise), represented by the yellow arrow.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/021a.png)

**Figure 21a: Allowed to stop at the boundary between the next section and the section after it while driving in the opposite direction: phases 1, 2, 3**

![In phase 3, the vehicle continues driving in the opposite (counterclockwise) direction. It stops (phase 4) exactly at the boundary between the neighboring straightforward section and the next section, as indicated by the red stop sign. The green checkmark indicates that this behavior is allowed according to the rules and that the round will not be stopped.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/021b.png)

**Figure 21b: Allowed to stop at the boundary between the next section and the section after it while driving in the opposite direction: phases 3, 4, 5**

![In phase 5, the vehicle resumes movement in the correct clockwise direction, following the blue arrow. The vehicle is now driving forward along the track in the round driving direction, as indicated by the dashed green arrow near the wall. The vehicle complies with the rules after stopping at the boundary and resuming forward movement.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/021c.png)

**Figure 21c: Allowed to stop at the boundary between the next section and the section after it while driving in the opposite direction: phase 5**

On the figure above the round driving direction is clockwise (presented by the green dotted arrow near to the wall):

- phase 1: the vehicle arrived in the corner section
- phase 2: it stopped
- phase 3: it started driving back
- phase 4: the vehicle stopped *at the boundary between the next section and the section*
- phase 5: it continued driving in the round driving direction.

Such sequence of movements is also allowed

### **Case 3: the vehicle started driving in the opposite direction and moved completely outside the neighbouring section**

If the vehicle passes the boundary between the neighbour section and the section after it, the
round will be stopped.

![In phase 1, the vehicle, represented by a red and yellow car, is moving in the correct clockwise direction (indicated by the blue arrow and the dashed green arrow near the wall, showing the round driving direction). In phase 2, the vehicle stops within the corner section, as indicated by the red stop sign. In phase 3, the vehicle starts driving in the opposite direction (counterclockwise), represented by the yellow arrow.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/022a.png)

**Figure 22a: Moving completely outside of the neighbour section while driving in the opposite direction is not allowed: phases 1, 2, 3**

![In phase 3, the vehicle continues driving in the opposite direction and moves completely outside the neighboring section into the next section, as indicated by the yellow arrow. A red X marks this behavior as incorrect since moving completely out of the neighboring section while driving in the opposite direction is not allowed. At this point, the round will be stopped by the judges.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/022b.png)

**Figure 22b: Moving completely outside of the neighbour section while driving in the opposite direction is not allowed: phase 3**

On the figure above:

- phase 1: the vehicle is initially moving in the round driving direction which is clockwise (presented by the green dotted arrow near to the wall)
- phase 2: it stopped
- phase 3: it started driving in the opposite direction and crosses two sections as, so it is completely outside of the neighbouring section.

### **Case 4: the vehicle changed the direction on the border between two sections**

If the vehicle changed the direction when its projection on the field crossed the line between two sections, the forward section is considered as the first one to determine the farthest section which is allowed to drive in the opposite direction.

![The image shows three diagrams illustrating two possible outcomes when a vehicle changes direction on the border between two sections. In the top diagram, the vehicle initially drives counterclockwise (indicated by the green dashed arrow) and stops on the line between two sections (phase 2). In the bottom left diagram, the vehicle continues driving in the opposite direction, passing completely outside the neighboring section (phase 3), which results in the round being stopped, as indicated by the red X. In the bottom right diagram, the vehicle reverses direction, stops on the section boundary (phase 4), and then continues in the correct round driving direction (phase 5), with the green checkmark indicating the round continues.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/023.png)

**Figure 23: The farthest section to drive in the opposite direction when the vehicle stopped partially in the section**

On the left side of the figure above the final of the following scenario is considered:

- phase 1: the vehicle initially drove through track CCW (reflected by the green dotted
arrow near to the wall)
- phase 2: it stopped on the line between two sections – the forward section in the round
driving direction is considered as the section where the direction was changed
- phase 3: it continued driving in the opposite direction and passed completely the section
which is the neighbour to the section where the direction was changed.

Such behaviour will lead to the immediate stop of the round.

The scenario in which the round continues is considered:

- phase 1: the vehicle initially drove through track CCW (reflected by the green dotted
arrow near to the wall)
- phase 2: it stopped on the line between two sections – the forward section in the round
driving direction is considered as the section where the direction was changed
- phase 3: it changed the direction and started moving in the opposite direction
- phase 4: the vehicle stopped at the border of two sections
- phase 5: it continued driving CCW

Since the vehicle’s projection is still partially in the neighbouring section the round is not stopped.

### **Case 5: changing the direction several times**

The vehicle is allowed to change the direction several times but the farthest section to drive in the opposite direction is considered based on the closest to the finish section where direction was changed the first time:

![The image consists of five diagrams illustrating the vehicle changing direction several times. In the first diagram (top row), the vehicle initially drives counterclockwise (phase 1), stops on the line between two sections (phase 2), and changes direction to move in the opposite direction (phase 3). In the second diagram, the vehicle continues moving, stops within the neighboring section (phase 4), and resumes the correct direction (phase 5). In the third diagram, the vehicle, while moving in the correct direction (phase 5), hits the wall around the game field (phase 6) and tries to recover by starting to move in the opposite direction again (phase 7). In the bottom two diagrams, the left side shows the vehicle continuing in the opposite direction and moving completely out of the neighboring section, causing the round to be stopped, as indicated by the red X. On the right side, the vehicle stops while partially overlapping the neighboring section (phase 8), which does not cause the round to stop. It then changes direction back to the correct one (phase 9) and continues the round, indicated by the green checkmark.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/024.png)

**Figure 24: Allowance of changing the direction several times considered based on the closest to the finish section**

The figure above allows to consider different outcomes for the case when the vehicle is changing
the direction several times:

- phase 1: the vehicle initially drove through track CCW (reflected by the green dotted
arrow near to the wall)
- phase 2: it stopped on the line between two sections – the forward section in the round
driving direction is considered as the section where the direction was changed
- phase 3: it changed the direction and started moving in the opposite direction
- phase 4 and 5: the vehicle stopped in the neighbouring section – next to the section
where the direction was initially changed then continued moving in the correct direction
- phase 6 and 7: the vehicle changed direction one more time, but this is not considered
since the previous section where the direction was changed to opposite is closer to the
finish
- if the vehicle completely goes out of the neighbouring section driving opposite the math
will be stopped (the left side of the figure)
- if only part of the vehicle’s projection is in the section next to the neighbouring section,
this will not be considered as a reason to stop the round (the right side of the figure)

### **Case 6:** Driving back-to-front

Driving back-to-front is allowed if the vehicle is being moved in the round driving direction.

![The image shows a yellow vehicle initially driving front-to-front (indicated by the blue arrow), hitting the wall, and then starting to drive back-to-front (indicated by the yellow arrow). The dashed green arrow near the wall shows the designated round driving direction. Both the blue and yellow arrows point in the same direction as the green dashed arrow, meaning the vehicle follows the correct movement pattern. A green checkmark indicates that this behavior is allowed.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/025.png)

**Figure 25: Back to front driving in the round driving direction**

In this direction the rules to pass the traffic signs are applied to the vehicle in the same manner – the red pillar must be passed from the right; the green pillar must be passed from the left.

![The image shows a yellow vehicle driving back-to-front, approaching a red traffic sign (pillar). The dashed green arrow near the wall shows the designated round driving direction, and the yellow arrow indicates the vehicle’s movement. According to the rules, the red pillar must be passed on the right side. The vehicle's path is shown following this rule, moving to the right of the red pillar as it drives back-to-front.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/026a.png)

**Figure 26a: The rule to pass the red traffic sign while driving back-to-front**

![The image shows a yellow vehicle driving back-to-front, approaching a green traffic sign (pillar). The dashed green arrow near the wall indicates the designated round driving direction, and the yellow arrow shows the vehicle’s movement. According to the rules, the green pillar must be passed on the left side. The vehicle's path is shown following this rule, moving to the left of the green pillar as it drives back-to-front.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/026b.png)

**Figure 26b: The rule to pass the green traffic sign while driving back-to-front**

## **5. Passing traffic signs from the incorrect side**

Although it is not allowed to pass traffic signs from the incorrect side, a threshold exists that can be used by the vehicle to recognize the fault state and fix the behaviour.

If the vehicle started passing the traffic sign improperly the time will not be stopped if the vehicle does not pass completely the line that goes from the interior wall to the exterior wall (later, – radius) and where the traffic sign is located.

![The image shows a top-down view of a yellow car moving along the blue arrow direction, attempting to pass a green pillar. The dashed green arrow represents the randomized driving direction. The vehicle is passing the green pillar on the right, although it is supposed to pass it on the left. The car has partially crossed the radius line, which extends from the inner wall to the outer wall, but has not fully passed it. A green checkmark indicates that the time will not be stopped since the vehicle has not completely crossed the line, allowing it to correct its path.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/027.png)

**Figure 27: The vehicle does not pass the radius while driving from the right of the green pillar**

![The image shows a top-down view of a yellow car moving along the blue arrow direction, attempting to pass a red pillar. The dashed green arrow represents the randomized driving direction. The vehicle is passing the red pillar on the left, although it is supposed to pass it on the right. The car has partially crossed the radius line, which extends from the inner wall to the outer wall, but has not fully passed it. A green checkmark indicates that time will not be stopped, allowing the vehicle to correct its path.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/028.png)

**Figure 28: The vehicle does not pass the radius while driving from the right of the red pillar**

As soon as the radius is completely crossed by vehicle judges will stop the round.

![The image shows a top-down view of a yellow car moving along the blue arrow direction, attempting to pass a green pillar. The dashed green arrow indicates the randomized driving direction. The vehicle has completely crossed the radius line, which extends from the inner wall to the outer wall, while passing the green pillar from the right side (incorrectly). A red X indicates that the judges will stop the round at this point since the vehicle has fully crossed the line.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/029.png)

The vehicle has completely crossed the radius line, which extends from the inner wall to the outer wall, while passing the red pillar from the left side (incorrectly). A red X indicates that the judges will stop the round at this point since the vehicle has fully crossed the line.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/030.png)

**Figure 30: The vehicle completely crosses the radius from the left side of the red pillar**

The same is applicable for the case when the vehicle is moving back-to-front in the round driving direction.

![The image shows two schemes of a yellow car moving in reverse along the blue arrow direction, following the correct driving direction (indicated by the dashed green arrow as counterclockwise). In the left scheme, the vehicle incorrectly passes the red pillar from the left side but has not fully crossed the radius line, allowing time to correct its path. In the right scheme, while it continues moving, it passes the red pillar incorrectly and fully crosses the radius line, which causes the round to be stopped, as indicated by the red X.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/031.png)

**Figure 31: The vehicle passes the radius while driving back-to-front**

<new_in_2024>In the obstacle challenge traffic signs only have to be obeyed on the three official laps. On the subsequent route to the parking lot, they can be bypassed to the right or left as desired. Moving them is still not permitted.</new_in_2024>

## **6. Parking in the parking lot**

<new_in_2024>

A robot is considered fully parked, when the projection of the robot on the mat is fully inside the rectangle between the two markers of the parking lot.

![The image shows the straightforward section of the game field with a grey rectangular area indicating the allowed parking space. The grey area does not exist on the actual field but is used here to illustrate the designated parking zone. The parking area is marked by two pink lines on either side, representing the boundaries of the parking lot.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/032a.png)

**Figure 32a: Grey area (does not exists on the real game field) indicates the allowed area for parking.**

![The image shows the straightforward section of the game field with a red vehicle fully parked inside the grey rectangular parking area. The vehicle is positioned parallel to the outer wall, and its projection is entirely within the boundaries of the parking lot, marked by two pink lines on either side.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/032b.png)

**Figure 32b: Fully parked situations - The robot is fully in and parallel to the outer wall.**

![The image shows the straightforward section of the game field with a red vehicle fully parked inside the grey rectangular parking area. Although the vehicle is not parallel to the outer wall, its projection is entirely within the boundaries of the parking lot, marked by two pink lines on either side. This situation is still considered fully parked.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/032c.png)

**Figure 32c: Fully parked situations - Although the car is not parked parallel to the outer wall, it counted fully in.**

The robot is considered partly parked, when the projection of the robot on the mat is partly inside the parking lot.

![The image shows the straightforward section of the game field with a red vehicle partially parked inside the grey rectangular parking area. The vehicle's projection is partly within the boundaries of the parking lot, marked by two pink lines on either side. This situation is considered "partly parked" according to the rules.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/033.png)
