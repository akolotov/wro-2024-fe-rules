# **1. General information**

## **Introduction**

In the WRO Future Engineers category teams need to focus on all parts of the engineering
process. The teams get points for documenting their process and making a public GitHub
repository. <new_in_2024>Every year a 20 to 30% change will be made to the challenges. </new_in_2024> The whole challenge will change every 4-5 years.

In the Self-Driving Cars challenge a robotic vehicle needs to drive autonomously on a parkours that randomly changes for each competition round.

## **Focus Areas**

Every WRO category has a special focus on learning with robots. In the WRO Future Engineers
category, students will focus on developing in the following areas:

- Use of computer vision and sensor fusion to estimate the state of the parkours and the
vehicle itself.
- A working vehicle with open-source hardware such as electromechanical components
and controllers.
- Action planning and control of robots with moving parts and kinematics different from
the differential drive (e.g., steering).
- Optimal strategies to solve the mission, including stability of mission solving.
- Teamwork, communication, problem solving, project management, creativity.
- An Engineering journal to show progress and design strategies.

For teams that are interested in participating in this category a Getting Starting guide was
created. This guide explains more about the vehicle requirements, possible technical solution,
and errors. Here students can start to get an idea of how-to setup a vehicle for this competition.

## **Learning is most important**

WRO wants to inspire students around the world for STEM related subjects and we want the
students to develop their skills through playful learning in our competitions. Therefore, the
following aspects are key for all our competition programs:

- Teachers, parents, or other adults can help, guide, and inspire the team, but are not
allowed to build or code/program the robot.
- Teams, coaches, and judges accept our WRO Guiding Principles and WRO Ethics
Code that should make all of us aware of a fair and learning full competition.
- On a competition day, Teams and Coaches respect the final decision judges take and
work with other teams and judges on a fair competition.
