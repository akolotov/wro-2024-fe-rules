## **Game Table & Field**

13.1. Size of the game mat is 3200 x 3200 mm (+/- 5 mm). The internal square within the game mat is the racetrack with inner size 3000 x 3000 mm (+/- 5 mm).

13.2. The main colour of the track is white.

13.3. The track is surrounded by (exterior) walls with inner height 100 mm.

13.4. The inner colour of the exterior walls is black. The outer colour of the walls is not defined.

13.5. There exist additional (interior) walls surrounding the internal section of the track with the height 100 mm.

![The image shows a section of the robotics competition field with both exterior and interior walls. The height of both walls is 100 mm, and the walls are black.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/010.png)

**Figure 10: Height of the exterior and interior walls**

13.6. The outer colour of the interior walls is black. The inner colour of the walls is black. The colour of the top edge of the walls is black.

13.7. The thickness of both exterior and interior walls is not defined.

13.8. The distance between exterior and interior walls depends on the round type and is specified in the Game Alternatives section.

13.9. There are orange and blue lines on the track. The thickness of the lines is 20 mm. The colour of the orange lines is CMYK (0, 60, 100, 0). The colour of the blue lines is CMYK (100, 80, 0, 0).

13.10. There are dashed lines with thickness 1 mm on the field to bound the vehicle’s starting zones. The colour of dashed lines is CMYK (0 0 0 30).

13.11. The size of every starting zone is 200 x 500 mm.

13.12. There are squares to identify places where traffic signs could be located. The line thickness of the traffic sing seat is 1 mm, and the colour of the line is CMYK (0 0 0 30).

13.13. The size of every traffic sign seat is 50x50 mm.

13.14. The area to evaluate if a traffic sign is moved is specified as a circle around the corresponding traffic sign’s seat. The thickness of the circle line is 0.5 mm. The colour of the lines is CMYK (20 0 100 0).

13.15. The diameter of the circle is 85 mm.

![The image shows a detailed game field map for a robotics competition. The mat size is 3200 x 3200 mm, with an internal racetrack of 3000 x 3000 mm. The field is mostly white with orange and blue lines, each 20 mm thick. Dashed lines mark the vehicle’s starting zones, and squares indicate where traffic signs can be placed. Each traffic sign seat is 50 x 50 mm with an evaluation circle of 85 mm diameter around it. Various dimensions and color codes are shown to specify field measurements and markings.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/011.png)

### **Walls configuration for the International Final**

13.16. The inner walls will be placed in a square or rectangular shape according to the draw. The outer walls will be fixed in a square shape and will not change during challenges.

13.17. The colour of the walls will be black.

13.18. Although everything will be done by the organisers get the colours of the field mat and field objects as close as possible to the CMYK specification, differences might still appear. Teams will have the opportunity to calibrate and fine tune their vehicles to the colours on the board and field objects during testing rounds.

## **Traffic Signs**

13.19. Every traffic sign is a rectangular parallelepiped with dimensions 50x50x100 mm.

13.20. Depending on the randomization process before every round there could be up to 7 red parallelepipeds and up to 7 green parallelepipeds.

13.21. The colour of the red traffic signs is RGB (238, 39, 55).

13.22. The colour of the green traffic signs is RGB (68, 214, 44).

13.23. The material of the traffic sign is not defined.

13.24. The weight of the traffic sign is not defined.

![The image shows two traffic signs used in the robotics competition field. One is green, and the other is red, both rectangular pillars with identical dimensions: 100 mm in height and 50 mm x 50 mm in width and depth.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/012.png)
