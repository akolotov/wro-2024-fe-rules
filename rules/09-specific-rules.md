# **9. Specific Game Rules**

## **Challenge Round Timing**

9.1. Open Challenge rounds will be three minutes in length.

9.2. Obstacle Challenge rounds will be three minutes in length.

## **Start Configuration**

9.3. The direction to drive the track is chosen randomly before each Challenge round in the
series, after the check time.

9.4. The starting position of the vehicle and the field configuration are determined before
starting every round, after the check time.

9.5. The direction to drive, starting position, and the field configuration remain the same for
all teams during the same round.

## **Round Start**

9.6. The vehicle is placed in the starting zone totally **SWITCHED OFF**!

9.7. The position of the vehicle in the starting zone must be so the projection of the car on the game mat is completely within the start zone.

9.8. The vehicle must be oriented so that the two wheels on the front axle (the judges must ask the team in advance which is axle is a front one) are located closer to the next corner section in the round driving direction whereas other two wheels are located closer to the corner section in opposite direction.

9.9. Physical adjustments can be made (this is part of the preparation time). However, it is not allowed to enter data to a program by changing positions or orientation of the vehicle parts or to make any sensor calibrations on the vehicle. It is not allowed to enter data by changing the switches configuration, if any. If a team does enter data through physical adjustments, it will be disqualified for that round.

9.10. The vehicle is then switched on. Only one switch is allowed to switch the vehicle on.

9.11. After vehicle is switched on, the vehicle should then be in a waiting state. Waiting for a Start button to be pressed. The Start button could be on the main SBC/SBM or a separately installed Push Button. Only one Start button is allowed. <new_in_2024>On an EV3, only one program will be allowed. The run button must be pressed to start the last program that was run on the EV3. The EV3 must then wait for a start button to be pressed. The start button on the EV3 can be a touch sensor or the right arrow button. On a Spike robot only Slot One can be used. The same procedure for the EV3 must be followed.</new_in_2024>

9.12. <new_in_2024>It is the responsibility of the team to check the layout of the racetrack and make sure it is correct. The judge will ask if the team is ready. The team must answer Yes to show their acceptance of the racetrack layout. No re-starts will be allowed if the team realised after the start, that the racetrack layout was not correct.</new_in_2024>

9.13.  A judge gives the signal to start the vehicle. Judge will count “Three, two, one, Go”. On the “Go” command the starting button is then pressed and the time for the attempt is started. The vehicle will have the amount of time to complete the round that is mentioned in the Game Rules.

9.14. Pressing the start button must start the vehicle action to attempt the challenge round
and the vehicle should start moving.

## **Additional Pieces**

9.15. The vehicle is not allowed to leave additional pieces on the game field or leave marks that are not removable (e.g., paint) during the round intentionally. If the vehicle violates this rule, the round will be stopped, and the vehicle must be stopped by one of the team’s members. The score for this round will be zero and the time mark will be the maximum. The judges have the right to inspect the team’s code if they suspect such a situation.

## **During the Round**

9.16. The vehicle must drive in the direction that was defined as the challenge driving direction before the challenge start.

9.17. The vehicle’s dimensions must not exceed 300x200 mm and 300 mm in height.

9.18. The vehicle is not allowed to ***move*** the walls (if they are not completely fixed on the field). The vehicle that violates this rule will be stopped by one of the team’s members, the score for this round will be zero and time mark will be the maximum. If the vehicle touches or bumps the walls, and the walls ***are not moved***, the vehicle may continue the round, and no penalties will be incurred. If the vehicle bumps or touches the walls and the vehicle stops, as a result of bumping or touching, a repairing action can be done, and penalties will be incurred. <new_in_2024>During the open challenge rounds the vehicle may not touch the outer boundary wall.</new_in_2024>

9.19. The vehicle must pass the traffic sign represented by the red pillar on the right (the picture a) and the traffic sign represented by the green pillar on the left (the picture b). <new_in_2024>The appendix A section 5 defines, when a traffic light was passed on the wrong side and how it is scored.</new_in_2024>

![The image shows two scenes from a robotics competition field demonstrating the rules for passing traffic signs. In the left image (a), the yellow self-driving car bypasses the green pillar, approaches the red pillar, and the green arrow indicates that the red pillar must be passed on the right. In the right image (b), the car bypasses the red pillar, finishes a turn from the straightforward section, and approaches the green pillar, with the green arrow indicating it must be passed on the left.](https://github.com/akolotov/wro-2024-fe-rules/blob/bb15b8ac7644dd19ec78d8149257dc76611e7d70/rules/figures/009.png)

**Figure 9: The rules to pass the traffic signs**

9.20. The vehicle is allowed to <new_in_2024>touch</new_in_2024>, move or knock down the traffic signs (coloured pillars) while the projection of the traffic sign is within the circle drawn around the traffic sign’s seat. For more details refer to Appendix A, section 1.

9.21. The vehicle is allowed to drive in the direction opposite to the round driving direction for two sections only: the section where the direction was changed and the neighbouring section.

9.22. The vehicle must return to the starting section after driving three laps to get additional points. Note: as soon as the vehicle partially leaves the starting section this section also becomes the finish section.

9.23. Once per round the team can ask permission for repairing actions: to take the vehicle out, fix the issue with mechanical or electronic parts, and put the vehicle back to the track in the centre of the section the vehicle was taken out of. The vehicle may be switched off when it is removed from the track. The vehicle may be switched on after it is put down on the track. The vehicle may then be switched on and put into motion again by pressing the start button. The round timer will not be stopped for the repairing action. The permission can be granted only if the vehicle has stopped. Possible reasons for the stop, are issues with electronics/mechanics or because the vehicle hit the wall and is stuck, or the vehicle just stops for no reason. The permission will not be granted for a moving vehicle – if any of its parts drives for approximately 50 mm in 5 seconds. The permission will not be granted if the vehicle has started the third lap (completely passed the corner section before the last lap). It is not allowed to upload programs on any controller of the vehicle as part of repairing actions. It is not allowed to enter any data. The team that violates these rules will be disqualified from this round: the score for this round will be zero and the time mark will be the maximum.

## **Round End**

9.24. The round ends and time is stopped if any of the following conditions occurs:

9.24.1. The round timer expires.

9.24.2. <new_in_2024>In Open Challenge:</new_in_2024> After three complete laps the vehicle stops in the finish section so that the projection of the vehicle on the field is completely within the section. For more details refer to Appendix A, section 2.

***Note 1**: the vehicle must stop in the finish section autonomously. If team participant forces the end of the round by using one of the methods described below when the vehicle is within the finish section, this will not be considered an autonomous stop and points for stopping in the finish section will not be assigned.*

***Note 2**: to demonstrate a complete stop in the finish section, the vehicle must not continue driving after 15 seconds. If after the end of the round the vehicle continues moving, judges could find the behaviour of the vehicle ambiguous and may not assign a point for the stop in the finish section.*

9.24.3. <new_in_2024>In Open Challenge:</new_in_2024> After three complete laps the vehicle passes the finish section so that its projection on the mat is completely within the corner section next to the finish section in the round driving direction. For more details refer to Appendix A, section 3. The vehicle crosses section boundaries twice while driving in the direction which is opposite to the round driving direction. For more details refer to Appendix A, section 4.

9.24.4. <new_in_2024>In Obstacle Challenge: After 3 rounds have been completed correctly, the vehicle stops. Either in the correct section or in the parking lot.</new_in_2024>

9.24.5. <new_in_2024>In Obstacle Challenge:</new_in_2024> After passing a traffic sign from the incorrect side, the vehicle completely crosses the line which goes from the inner border to the outer border and where this traffic sign is located. For more details refer to Appendix A, section 5.

9.24.6. <new_in_2024>In Obstacle Challenge: The robot moved a traffic sign outside of the circle.<new_in_2024>

9.24.7. <new_in_2024>In Obstacle Challenge: The robot touches the parking lot limitations.<new_in_2024>

9.24.8. The vehicle’s dimensions still exceed the limit, after 3-minute repairing time. 

9.24.9. Any team member touches the vehicle without the judge’s permission for repairing
actions.

9.24.10. Any team member touches the field mat and wall without the judge’s permission for repairing actions.

9.24.11. Any team member touches the game elements. 

9.24.12. The vehicle drives outside of the track (by moving the wall) or outside of the game field.

9.24.13. The vehicle or team member damages the field or a game element.

9.25. Notice that, according to the above rules, the team can stop their attempt (e.g., by touching the field wall or doing any of the above rules). However, they will not be able to resume the attempt after the stop and the round will be ended.

9.26. The judges will base their decisions on the rules and fair game play. They have the final
decision on the competition day. If there is any uncertainty during the task completion,
the judges will bias their decision to the worst outcome available for the context of the
situation.
