# Questions and answers

This section contains questions and answers related to the World Robot Olympiad Future Engineers competition rules for the 2024 season. The Q&As provide additional clarification and interpretation of the official rules to assist in resolving ambiguities or edge cases that may arise during competition preparation or execution. While not part of the official game rules, these Q&As reflect the intent behind the rules and should be considered authoritative guidance for teams, judges, and other stakeholders involved in the competition. The information here supplements the main game rules and should be used in conjunction with the official rules to ensure consistent application and understanding across all competition events.

### Use of Electronic Differentials in Vehicle Design

Q: Is it permissible to use an electronic differential in our vehicle design for the WRO Future Engineers competition? An electronic differential would allow independent control of motor torque for each driving wheel based on steering input and desired overall torque.

A: No, the use of electronic differentials is not permitted in the WRO Future Engineers competition. This decision is based on several factors:
- The competition rules require a physical connection between the driving wheels, which an electronic differential does not provide.
- The rules specify "one driving axle," implying a mechanical linkage between wheels rather than independent electronic control.
- There are concerns about verifying whether an electronic differential is being used solely for steering compensation or as a differential drive system, which could potentially violate the rule against differential wheeled robots.
- To ensure fairness and clarity in judging, especially at the International Final level, such systems are not allowed.

### Vehicle Starting Positions in Open and Obstacle Challenges

Q: What are the allowed starting positions for vehicles in the Open and Obstacle challenges?

A: The starting positions differ between challenges:
- Open Challenge: Vehicle can start from any of the 6 positions in the starting section (outside the inner wall)
- Obstacle Challenge: Vehicle must start from one of the 2 middle positions, determined by traffic sign placement to avoid direct frontal obstruction

### Clear Path at Vehicle Start

Q: Can traffic signs be placed directly in front of a vehicle's starting position?

A: No, traffic signs will not be placed directly in front of a vehicle's starting position in the direction of movement.

This rule is designed to help teams avoid immediate failures at the start of their run and to ensure a fair beginning for all participants. It allows each vehicle to have a clear initial path as it begins its movement.

Key points to note:
1. While traffic signs may be present in various parts of the starting section, they will not obstruct the vehicle's initial path.
2. The challenge of navigating around traffic signs begins after the vehicle starts moving, not at the moment of initialization.
3. For the International Final, specific procedures will be in place to guarantee that vehicles start from zones without traffic signs directly in front of them.

### The Last Traffic Sign in a Lap

Q: How to identify which traffic sign should be considered the last one in a lap when there are multiple signs on the track, particularly when signs are placed in different sections including the starting section?

A: The last traffic sign in a lap is defined as the final traffic sign that the vehicle must react to (by passing it on the correct side) before completing its full circuit around the track. This may not coincide with the technical completion of the lap, as the vehicle might need to pass a traffic sign in the starting section that was initially behind its starting position. The key is that while a lap may be considered complete when crossing certain boundaries, the last traffic sign is determined by the final sign the vehicle must properly respond to in its path around the circuit.

### Direction Change Rules After Red Sign on Second Lap

Q: What are the direction change rules when a vehicle encounters a red traffic sign as the last sign of the second lap?

A: When a vehicle encounters a red traffic sign as the last sign of the second lap:
Required Behavior:

1. The vehicle must first complete the second lap by fully crossing into the starting section
2. After completing the second lap, the vehicle should change its driving direction to the opposite of its current direction:
  - If driving clockwise, should switch to counterclockwise
  - If driving counterclockwise, should switch to clockwise

If Error Occurs:
- The round will continue without interruption
- The vehicle may detect and correct its direction at any point during the third lap
- Points are awarded based on the direction at lap completion:
  - 15 points awarded if the final lap is completed in the correct direction
  - 0 points awarded if the final lap is completed in the wrong direction

The vehicle has the entire third lap to detect and correct any direction errors to earn the direction points.

### Points Scoring for Incorrect Final Lap Direction

Q: In the Obstacle Challenge, if a vehicle completes three laps but drives the final lap in the wrong direction, does it earn any points or should it be stopped?

A: The vehicle should not be stopped and can still earn points even when driving the final lap in the wrong direction. Available points include:

- Points for completing the first two laps
- Up to 8 points for sections visited during the third lap
- 1 point for completing the third lap
- Points for correct handling of traffic signs throughout all laps
- Points for successful parking

The only penalty is not receiving the 15 points awarded for completing the final lap in the correct direction.
