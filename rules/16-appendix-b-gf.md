# **Appendix B: Game field for national/regional finals**

The main difference in the game field preparation for national/regional finals from the international final is how to build the interior wall, since the wall configuration depends on the randomization that happens before every qualification round.

Below is the recommendation that can be used to prepare segments of the interior wall.

First, this recommendation assumes that the material of the interior wall is wood/particleboard/MDF. Then, the wall consists of four parts: two long segments and two short segments and the thickness of every segment is the same. These segments are fixed together by using confirmat screws or dome screws and insert nuts. The height of the segments is 100 mm. The colour of the segments is black.

![The image shows a schematic representation of the interior wall segments used in the robotics competition field. It features two long segments and two short segments, each with identical thickness, marked as ￼$L_e$ for the long segments and ￼$L_i$ for the short segments. These segments are assembled to form the interior walls of the game field, and they are joined using confirmat screws or dome screws with insert nuts. The diagram highlights the relative dimensions and positions of the segments.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcc84f75-a08e-44e5-94e8-8418e8377ebf/7a821c7e-64b4-4fad-b9b2-0ff032529d5a/image.png)

**Figure 34: Scheme of segments used for the interior wall**

So, all possible configurations of the inner wall could be achieved if the following sets of segments are prepared:

| **Long segments (**$L_e$**)** | **Short segments (**$L_i$**)** |
| --- | --- |
| 2 segments per 1000 mm | 2 segments per (1000 − 2𝑤) mm |
| 2 segments per 1400 mm  | 2 segments per (1400 − 2𝑤) mm |
| 2 segments per 1800 mm | 2 segments per (1800 − 2𝑤) mm |
|  | *where* 𝑤 *is the thickness of a segment* |

For example, if the segment thickness is 17 mm, the lengths of short segments will be 966 mm, 1366 mm, and 1766 mm.

After the randomization prior to a round, the corresponding combination of segments is fixed together by screws and located on the field. To make the construction harder to move by the vehicle, some weight could be located on the inner side of the wall’s corners.
